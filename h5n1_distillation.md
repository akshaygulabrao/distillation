## Introduction
1. Flus are caused by the influenza virus family.
2. Influenza A came from 500BC - 1500AD from birds
3. Big pandemic every few decades, small seasonal epidemics every year
4. The seasonal epidemics vary in severity based on two things
    - Severity of the virus itself
    - how closely the people's flu antibodies match the virus
5. Spanish Flu of 1918 killed 2% of the world's population
    - Everyone below the age of 88 died especially (18-28)
        - 88+ were exposed to the virus in 1830
        - H3N8 virus happened in 1890-1900, making 18-28 vulnerable
    - The memory of which antibodies the body keeps is weird
## Recent History of the flu
1. 1918: H1N1 Jumped from birds to humans in America
    - Killed 50M people 
2. 1957: H2N2 Jumped from birds to humans in China
    - Killed 2M people
3. 1968: H3N2 Jumped from pigs? to humans in Hong Kong
    - Killed 2M people
4. 1977: H1N1 Russian lab leak? 
    - Neglibile
5. 2009: H1N1 Jumped from pigs to humans in Mexico
    - 200K people died

## The Bird Flu
1. Influenza A evolved in birds
2. It usually mixes with a human flu virus 
3. Pigs are vulnerable to both bird and human flu viruses
    - No real epidemiological differences between from-birds and from-pigs
4. Every human it infects increases the chance of a viable human-to-human virus

## What is the Chance of Pandemic?
1. Prediction markets bets on >10k cases by EOY
    - Manifold: 40%
    - Metaculus: 5%
2. Metaculus seems to be more accurate
    - hosts disease-forceasting competitions
3. 2 strong Metacalculus forecasters:
    - Unlikely more than one mutation away
        - Other similar viruses went nowhere
4. Pandemic before 2030:
    - Manifold: 50%
    - Metaculus: 30%

## Theoretical Fatality Rate
1. Case for 50%:
    - Some rumors but evidence is weak
2. Case for 1.25%:
    - Transmission medium bottlenecks fatality
    - People innately less susceptible to H5N1
3. Case for .01% - .02%:
    - Recent flu pandemics were approximatley 0.2%
    - Known procedure for control
4. Case for 2-10%:
    - Case for spanish flu, maybe the procedure won't work

## Other Factors
1. Animal transmission is enough for human repercussions to commodities markets
2. Transmission channel through raw milk
    - hard to quantify
3. H5N1 vaccines already exist for chickens

## Conclusions
1. H5N1 is already a threat under control for animals
2. 5% chance of EOY pandemic, 50% chance before 2030
3. Probably as sever ase asian flu
