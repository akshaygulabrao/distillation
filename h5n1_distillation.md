## Introduction
1. Flus are caused by the influenza virus family.
2. Influenza A came from 500BC - 1500AD from birds
3. Big pandemic every few decades, small seasonal epidemics every year
4. The seasonal epidemics vary in severity based on two things
    - Severity of the virus itself
    - how closely the people's flu antibodies match the virus
5. Spanish Flu of 1918 killed 2% of the world's population
    - Everyone below the age of 88 died especially (18-28)
        - 88+ were exposed to the virus in 1830
        - H3N8 virus happened in 1890-1900, making 18-28 vulnerable
    - The memory of which antibodies the body keeps is weird
